## Summary

[hj-nc-news](https://hj-nc-news.netlify.app/) is a basic web app to allow navigation through articles written by users for users from this API: [hjeffs-nc-news](https://hjeffs-nc-news.onrender.com/api).

Usage of the app should be straightforward in that the links should direct you to new pages and display the relevant information. 

The site is unfinished and has some undesirable user interactions that I aim to fix in the future. As shown on the homepage, this is a first attempt at deploying a front end (which I am aware is functional and unfinished).

Render can take a while to load the articles and the app will show 
    
    Loading...

I have tested the site on multiple devices and it will load, it just could take a while as the implementation of all aspects of this has cost Â£0. 


## Prerequisites

Node.js: v14.0.0


## 1: Installation and Setup

From your terminal:

    cd your-desired-directory

    git clone https://github.com/hjeffs/fe-nc-news

    cd fe-nc-news


## 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed, then:

      npm i

This should install all dependencies required / used in the app.

## 3: Additional Information

This project is by no means a finished product, it has a long way to go (as do I).

I have multiple refactors and structure updates that I would like to include in the future and I will try my best to implement them.

I appreciate anyone taking an interest in my work and feedback is always appreciated.
